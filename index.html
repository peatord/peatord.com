        <p>Hello, I'm Peter, a molecular biologist interested in programming, software minimalism, cryptography, nature, and more. I've been a full time linux user for about 3 years now and can't imagine switching back to windows. I use arch btw. I'm always looking to learn new things and expand my horizons. Some of my projects are on github and are mainly for manipulation or conversion of data types used in genome assembly and annotation. The source code to this very <a href="https://github.com/peatord/peatord.com">website</a> is available on my github too!</p>
        </div>

            <h2>> time --now</h2>
            <p>Currently I'm doing my PhD. in molecular biology. In my free time I'm learning mobile development, more specifically, Dart and Flutter. I'm also reading Neuromancer by William Gibson. </p>
